# LangChain Practical Implementations with Groq API

## Overview
This repository contains practical implementations of LangChain features using the Groq API. It demonstrates how to manage multiple chat sessions, generate responses in different languages, and trim chat history efficiently.

## Before Running the notebook read the below things:

GROQ:
It gives access to many opensource LLMs just with the help of API.
- https://groq.com/ visit this website and make a account
- Inferencing â€“ When u hit the LLM in your local or from cloud how fast you are able to get the response 
- GO to API keys create a API key and store it into a .env file of yours

## Features
- **Groq API Integration**: Securely storing and using the Groq API key.
- **Multiple Session Handling**: Utilizing `BaseChatMessageHistory`, `ChatMessageHistory`, and `RunnableWithMessageHistory` for managing different chat sessions.
- **Multilingual Responses**: Fetching chat responses in different languages.
- **Chat History Management**: Trimming previous chat history to optimize performance.
